# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

# ReadMe E-Commerce Back End

The task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

node server.js

Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.


A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the note taker app.

SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies


## Acceptance Criteria


GIVEN a functional Express.js API

 environment variable file

THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands

THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application

THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL
database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
